# First Milestone

My first milestone involved assembling and testing the Cokoino robotic arm using assembly guides and sample code provided by Cokoino. Before assembling the arm, I used sample code to test the servo motors and realign their angles to 90Â°.

As I worked through this process, I encountered my first issue. After I tested two of the four servos, my computer stopped recognizing the Arduino Nano that is used in this project. I fixed this issue by restarting my computer, which allowed my Windows operating system to correctly identify the Nano again.

After I finished testing and aligning the servos, I continued with the assembly of the structure of the arm. Due to the small size of some of the parts, the assembly was at times difficult, but I can now control my robotic arm using the attached joysticks.

The Arduino Nano runs a program provided by Cokoino that accepts the potentiometer input of two joysticks and converts the input to the proper angles for the servos to rotate to. I will modify my project so that I can control the arm using a Raspberry Pi 4 rather than the Arduino Nano. To accomplish this, I will write a custom Python program for interfacing with the servos and joysticks.

<!---# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. -->

[Here]([url](https://github.com/Cokoino/CKK0006/blob/master/Lesson%204%20-%20Test%20The%20Joystick%20Module/code/joystick/joystick.ino)) is the code used to test the joysticks.

[Here]([url](https://github.com/Cokoino/CKK0006/blob/master/Lesson%205%20-%20Test%20The%20Servo/code/servo_code1/servo_code1.ino)) is the code used to test the servos.

[Here]([url](https://github.com/Cokoino/CKK0006/tree/master/Lesson%207%20-%20Control%20The%20Robot%20Arm/Code/Arm)) is the code used to control the completed arm using the Arduino Nano. (Note: the src folder must be in the same directory as the main code for the main code to upload to the Arduino Nano correctly.)
