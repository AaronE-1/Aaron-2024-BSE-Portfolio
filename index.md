# Aaron's Three-Jointed Robotic Arm
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

My first milestone involved assembling and testing the Cokoino robotic arm using assembly guides and sample code provided by Cokoino. Before assembling the arm, I used sample code to test the servo motors and realign their angles to 90Â°. As I worked through this process, I encountered my first issue. After I tested two of the four servos, my computer stopped recognizing the Arduino Nano that is used in this project. I fixed this issue by restarting my computer, which allowed my Windows operating system to correctly identify the Nano again. After I finished testing and aligning the servos, I continued with the assembly of the structure of the arm. Due to the small size of some of the parts, the assembly was at times difficult, but I can now control my robotic arm using the attached joysticks. The Arduino Nano runs a program provided by Cokoino that accepts the potentiometer input of two joysticks and converts the input to the proper angles for the servos to rotate to. I will modify my project so that I can control the arm using a Raspberry Pi 4 rather than the Arduino Nano. To accomplish this, I will write a custom Python program for interfacing with the servos and joysticks.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
